# Overview
This repo contains all of the work I captured for college, code-camps, and miscellaneous courses, as well as technical assignments for jobs
and other odds and ends that don't deserve their own repo but that I still want to capture somewhere.

Most of the stuff contained in this repo is here for legacy purposes only and is probably not in a working state.
